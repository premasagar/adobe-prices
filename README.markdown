What is RedLego?
----------------

It's been very difficult to compare the price of Adobe software from country to country in a meaningful way. So [RedLego](http://github.com/redlego) has created a [handy Python script](http://github.com/redlego/scraper/) that visits all of Adobe's online stores, checks the prices, converts them to $USD at the current exchange rate and puts them all into a [JSON data file](http://github.com/redlego/data/raw/master/prices.json).

### Data visualisation ###
The ["redlego-viz" repository](http://github.com/premasagar/redlego-viz), by [@premasagar](http://twitter.com/premasagar), contains a data visualisation for that data. With it, you can easily compare Adobe's prices around the world. How does your country fare? You can see the visualisation here:

### Discussion ###

You can find a long-running discussion of Adobe's international pricing here: [Why are UK prices nearly double US prices?](http://getsatisfaction.com/adobe/topics/why_are_uk_prices_nearly_double_us_prices).
